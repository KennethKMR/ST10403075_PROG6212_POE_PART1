I will breakdown how the prototype is intended on being used.
In the first field: "ID" the lecturer or programme coordinator or academic manager will be able to enter their ID in that field.
In the second field: : "Claim Amount", the lecturer will be able to enter the amount that they wish to claim
In the third field: "Date" the user lecturer will be able to select the date at which they are claiming.
In the fourth field: "Supporting Documents", the lecturer will be able to upload documents to help support their claim.
In the fifth field: "Claim Status", the lecturer will be able to track the status of their claim, to see whether it is still pending, got rejected or got approved.
And then the last two buttons:
Submit Claim and Reset.
Submit Claim button finalises the claim the lecturer wants to create and sends it through, and the Reset button wipes all data from the fields.
